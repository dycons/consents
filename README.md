# consents
A microservice for consents metadata

Strongly modeled on the [Go model service](https://github.com/CanDIG/go-model-service) built for CanDIG in Summer 2018. Aside from similarities in stack and structure, some code from the model service has also been copied and repurposed here. There may be slight implementation differences caused by version differences in the stack.
If you are interested in contributing to this toy service, or in building something similar, you may benefit from taking a look at the [Go model service](https://github.com/CanDIG/go-model-service) and its documentation. Please note that the service and documentation may be somewhat outdated.
