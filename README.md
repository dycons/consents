# Consents Service
A microservice for consents metadata

Strongly modeled on the [Go model service](https://github.com/CanDIG/go-model-service) built for CanDIG in Summer 2018 and upgraded in Summer 2020. The stacks are nearly identical and the implementations are very similar.
If you are interested in contributing to this toy service, or in building something similar, you may benefit from taking a look at the [Go model service](https://github.com/CanDIG/go-model-service) and its documentation.
